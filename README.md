# Hi there!
This is an assignment for codecademy.

### This is a simple JS function that takes an array of jokes and puns from the book No Pun Intended featured in The Last Of Us on HBO.

### Added another simple practice function that takes a poem and makes a word a=out of the first index of every line in the poem.

To run the program, 
- Branch project
- Load it on your preferred text editor
- Open terminal

#### This is the beginning of a project that will be expanded in the future.
